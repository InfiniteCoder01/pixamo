# Pixamo
Generates sprites from pixel art skeleton
Made originally in python as a tool for my game for
[OLC CodeJam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/olc-codejam-2024),
could be used as a submission by itself :)
Was rewritten as an Aseprite extension later.
Original python version: https://github.com/InfiniteCoder01/pixamo/tree/b55823266bc8e6cb334395a6bb073f74463088f3 

# Usage
Just download the extension file from releases and install it as a regular
Aseprite extension. Right-click the layer to (re)generate sprites.
Skin file name and layout is hardcoded, look at [examples](https://github.com/InfiniteCoder01/pixamo/tree/master/examples) to get started.
